#Computer Vision

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world. Using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning models, machines can accurately identify and classify objects — and then react to what they “see.”

I have tried applying haarcascade filters and have reached to some results which are not 100%, but this code will work much better for some clear videos and images.
There is a car detection code, car number plate detection code and a Pedestrian detection code in here.
